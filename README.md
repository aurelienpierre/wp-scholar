# WP Scholar

If you are a scientific or technical writer, you might feel WordPress and its Gutenberg editor are going backwards, in a Microsoft Office direction : giving an overwhelming set of formatting options while making actual **typing** really hard. Typing is creating on keyboard, and any side mouse-job is a loss of time and a risk of [Repetitive Strain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury).

WordPress is turning into a better place for marketers, but is becoming a nightmare for anyone doing content-driven posts (with text, references, graphs, charts, equations, tables, footnotes, bibliography, source code, etc.). While most technical writers have now turned toward static content generators (Hugo, Jekyll, etc.), and researchers keep writing fixed-width PDF papers (2021 muchâ€¦), WP Scholar is meant to make WordPress great again for you, writer :

1. **Newbie features** :
  * adds support for extended, Github-flavored, Markdown formatting in posts, pages and comments,
  * adds support for footnotes and inline hover cards for their content,
  * adds table of contents in posts and in sidebars with a widget,
  * adds internal anchors/permalinks to headers, to quickly index and link to your sections,
  * enforces correct typographic rules for the current language, like unbreakable and thin spaces where they belong,
2. **Intermediate features** :
  * adds support for Mermaid graphs, allowing to quickly plot charts from text,
  * adds support to include any local HTML file into posts and pages,
3. **Expert features** :
  * adds support for $\LaTeX$ equations in posts, comments and pages, with environments, references and numbered equations,
  * adds syntax highlighting on code blocks declared with a programming language (245 languages supported),
  * imports Jupyter notebooks with/or Plotly and Bokeh interactive graphs.
